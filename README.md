# Machine Learning Projects ðŸ§ 
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection includes various machine learning projects that I've worked on, showcasing my skills in data analysis, model building, and data visualization.

## Projects Overview ðŸ¤“
Each project in this repository is organized into its own folder and contains the following:

***Dataset:*** The data used for training and testing the model.

***Notebook:*** A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with code and explanations for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
